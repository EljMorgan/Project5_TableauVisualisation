Develop the system of Key Performance Indicators (or the system of widgets that should be shown). Please keep in mind:
you need to have at least 12 widgets that describe your data,
you have at least 2 widgets that should reflect forecasted value,
dashboard's style should reflect the domain.
Develop the idea of your dashboard:
what exactly you want to show?
what should be the layout?
which widgets represent the most powerful insights?
Your dashboard should give the possibility to filter the data
Describe the idea of the dashboard and each widget (what you want to show, why the particular chart is chosen), calculations in the readme file.
After your dashboard is ready, please, create a presentation.
